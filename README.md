# Question Answer Project with RNN and PyTorch

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Question Answering system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and PyTorch. The system is designed to process a dataset of unique question-answer pairs and train an RNN model to predict answers based on input questions.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Includes a dataset of 100 unique question-answer pairs.
- **RNN Implementation**: Two Jupyter notebooks (`RNN.ipynb` and `simple_RNN.ipynb`) showcasing different RNN architectures.
- **PyTorch Framework**: Utilizes PyTorch for building and training the RNN models.

## Files in the Repository
- `100_Unique_QA_Dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `RNN.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing a more advanced RNN architecture.
- `simple_RNN.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing a simpler RNN architecture.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- Additional Python libraries: pandas, numpy

## Installation
